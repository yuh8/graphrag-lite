Annex 3: Initial Target information

     cAMP and cAMP-inhibited cGMP 3’,5’-cyclic phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10a) belongs to the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase family. It plays a role in signal transduction by regulating the intracellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides. This enzyme can hydrolyze both cAMP and cGMP, having a higher affinity for cAMP. 

     PDE10a is abundant in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions of brain and testis, it is moderately expressed in the thyroid gland, pituitary gland, thalamus and cerebellum. The protein is composed of a C-terminal catalytic domain containing two putative divalent metal sites and an N-terminal regulatory domain, which contains one putative cGMP-binding region. Several members of the PDE family were crystallized and a there is a wide range of known substrates and inhibitors. 

Annex 4: CGX’ Know-how

     Genetic engineering, protein expression and renaturation. 

     At ComGenex we have extensive experience in genetic engineering and expressing sequences across various expression systems. We have developed unique protein renaturation capabilities for high yielding expression of functional proteins of your choice. We are active in the field of assay development and high-throughput screening.

     EMIL™ -based analogue generation 

     ComGenex has developed a knowledge base and software with Prof. Toshio Fujita (Kyoto) for bioanalogous lead evolution. The entry structures (validated hits, initial leads) are first imported into our EMIL software to create the bioanalogous expansion of the chemical space defined by the original hit molecules. 

 







†

 





 

     EMIL (Example Mediated Innovation for Lead Evolution) incorporates a knowledge base (collection of structural “evolution” examples) and an interactive search engine. By analyzing large number of biologically active compounds, several thousand structural “evolution” examples (from simple bioisosteric structural replacements to bioanalogous drastic skeletal changes) were identified and collected from literature into the EMIL database as virtual transformation rules. The resulting candidate lead structures could exhibit improved pharmacological/ pharmacokinetic characteristics, and help to reach novel intellectual property (IP) position.

     EMIL™-Select™ for target family-based drug design 

     In the post-genomic drug discovery large enzyme families are investigated parallel in order design selective inhibitors for many related isoforms in one combined research effort. Chemogenomics is a bioinformatics-driven approach to explore the ligand-target knowledge space based on the genetic (sequence homology) divergence of target family members. 

     This design approach identifies the major molecular determinants of the target-family (privileged structures/ special recognition features) and virtual transformations leading selectivity within the family. Using the knowledge base, which is an extension of the original EMIL™ concept (EMIL-Select™) scaffolds or robust inhibitors can be transformed into selective inhibitors (‘selectivity jumping’).

     Lead Multiplier™ technology 

     ComGenex’ Lead Multiplier™ technology is designed to integrate proprietary chemoinformatics tools in order to select, optimize and prioritize novel chemically distinct lead classes (de novo focused libraries) against particular targets for hit validation and lead explosion. 

 







†

 





 

     The program utilizes a unique medicinal chemistry knowledge based expert system, a proprietary similarity search tool, in silico pharmacokinetic filtering and diversity assessing methods. Lead Multiplier™ Focused Library demonstrates pharmaceutically relevant structural complexity and at the same time remains chemically distant from the original lead structures.

     FlashTag™ covalent labeling strategy 

     The major feature of covalent-bond forming libraries is a creation of a stable linkage between small molecules and biopolymers targeted by the ligand or substrate toward the active site. As the stable covalent linkage survives proteolysis, chemical fragmentation and sequencing, and the small molecule trapped within the active site during the entire manipulation, this technique enables the identification of the binding site. Combining with chemprobe™ combinatorial tethering approach the architecture of the binding site can be investigated.

     Parallel Lead Optimization Approach 

 







†

 





 

     The core of the ComGenex’ Parallel Lead Optimization Program is HT medicinal chemistry supported by QSAR modeling and EMIL™ (example-Mediated Innovation for Lead Evolution). Other supporting elements are: broad spectrum of in silico and in vitro ADMETox methods; complementing with ADMETox prefiltered screening libraries; ActiVerse™, prescreened targeted libraries; FlashTag™, a photomarker library for covalent protein tagging; HT Analytical services. ComGenex integrated these approaches into a service package, allowing the R&D activities to proceed simultaneously shortening the average preclinical development phase.
