ARTICLE 5.

DEFAULT; REMEDIES; SUBSTITUTE COLLATERAL

Section 5.1

Method of Realizing Upon the Pledged Property: Other Remedies.

If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:












(a)

The Secured Party may exercise in respect of the Pledged Property, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all of the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code (whether or not the Uniform Commercial Code applies to the affected Pledged Property), and also may (i) take absolute control of the Pledged Property, including, without limitation, transfer into the Secured Party's name or into the name of its nominee or nominees (to the extent the Secured Party has not theretofore done so) and thereafter receive, for the benefit of the Secured Party, all payments made thereon, give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect thereof and otherwise act with respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof, (ii) require the Company to assemble all or part of the Pledged Property as direct ed by the Secured Party and make it available to the Secured Party at a place or places to be designated by the Secured Party that is reasonably convenient to both parties, and the Secured Party may enter into and occupy any premises owned or leased by the Company where the Pledged Property or any part thereof is located or assembled for a reasonable period in order to effectuate the Secured Party's rights and remedies hereunder or under law, without obligation to the Company in respect of such occupation, and (iii) without notice except as specified below and without any obligation to prepare or process the Pledged Property for sale, (A) sell the Pledged Property or any part thereof in one or more parcels at a bona fide public or private sale, at any of the Secured Party's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and at a commercially reasonable price or prices and upon such other terms as the Secured Party may deem commerc ially reasonable and/or (B) lease, license or dispose of the Pledged Property or any part thereof upon terms the Secured Party may deem commercially reasonable.  The Company agrees that, whether or not notice of sale or any other disposition of the Pledged Property shall be required by law, the Secured Party shall give the Company at least fifteen (15) days' notice to the Company of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Pledged Property is to be made and that such notice shall constitute reasonable notification.  The Secured Party shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of any Pledged Property regardless of notice of sale having been given.  The Secured Party may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.  The Company hereby waives any claims against the Secured Party arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Pledged Property may have been sold at a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Obligations, even if the Secured Party accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Pledged Property to more than one offeree, and waives all rights that the Company may have to require that all or any part of such Pledged Property be marshaled upon any sale (public or private) thereof.  The Company hereby acknowledges that (i) any such sale of the Pledged Property by the Secured Party may be made without warranty, (ii) the Secured Party may specifically disclaim any warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment or the like, and (iii) such actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall not adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any such sale of Pledged Property.  












(b)

Any cash held by the Secured Party as Pledged Property and all cash proceeds received by the Secured Party in respect of any sale of or collection from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Pledged Property shall be applied (after payment of any amounts payable to the Secured Party pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof) by the Secured Party against, all or any part of the Obligations in such order as the Secured Party shall elect, consistent with the provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement.  Any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by the Secured Party and remaining after the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations shall be paid over to whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.

(c)

In the event that the proceeds of any such sale, collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Secured Party is legally entitled, the Company shall be liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the rate specified in the Convertible Debentures for interest on overdue principal thereof or such other rate as shall be fixed by applicable law, together with the costs of collection and the reasonable fees, costs, expenses and other client charges of any attorneys employed by the Secured Party to collect such deficiency.

(d)

The Company hereby acknowledges that if the Secured Party complies with any applicable state, provincial or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Pledged Property, such compliance will not adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Property.

(e)

The Secured Party shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including, but not limited to, this Agreement and the Pledged Property) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of the Secured Party's rights hereunder and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights, however existing or arising.  To the extent that the Company lawfully may, the Company hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshaling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the Secured Party's rights under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Obligations or under which any of the Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, the Company hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.

Section 5.2

Duties Regarding Pledged Property.

The Secured Party shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of the Pledged Property or any income thereon or as to the preservation of any rights pertaining thereto, beyond the safe custody and reasonable care of any of the Pledged Property actually in the Secured Party’s possession.
